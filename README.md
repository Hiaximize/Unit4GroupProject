## Gainz Tracker

Inspiration for project

I use to be an avid lifter and one thing I could never get into, was bringing a pen and notebook with me to the gym and write the notes inside during my workout. This topped with our love handles growing ever more, we decided we needed a solution to get us back in the gym

### Userstores
1. As a user I want to be able to come to Gainz Tracker and create a workout plan to use while in the gym

2. As a user I want to be able to save my past exercises and quickly add them to another workout

3. As a user I want to be able to add new exercises to use in workout plan

4. As a user I want to be able to edit/remove existing exercises

5. As a user I want to be able to track when I took protein/pre-workout/post workout supplements / meals
